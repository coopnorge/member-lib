# Introduction

Welcome to our shared Golang library! This documentation provides insights into the various packages available in our
repository and guides you through their practical applications.

## Motivation and Contribution

Member team focuses on end customer/consumer needs and is highly motivated to create and deliver solutions.
In these circumstances, we decided to share our domain-driven abstract code in a more independent way.
This approach will enable us to continue our development and meet our commitments without external dependencies.

We remain open to collaboration with the engineering outside Member's team. We believe that our code can be used not
only with our project but if it's needed can be refined to higher abstraction and moved out of this repository and
published to the world from the Coop organization.

## Key Princeliness

- Modularity - Simplify integration into existing projects.
- Reusability - Reducing the need for duplicate code and speeding up the development process.
- Scalability - Designed with scalability in mind, these packages can be easily adapted or extended.
