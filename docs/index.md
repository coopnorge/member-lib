# Introduction

Welcome to our shared Golang library! This documentation provides insights into
the various packages available in our repository and guides you through their
practical applications.

## Motivation and Contribution Member team focuses on

end customer/consumer needs and is highly motivated to create and deliver
solutions. In these circumstances, we decided to share our domain-driven
abstract code in a more independent way. This approach will enable us to
continue our development and meet our commitments without external
dependencies. We remain open to collaboration with the engineering outside
Member's team. We believe that our code can be used not only with our project
but if it's needed can be refined to higher abstraction and moved out of this
repository and published to the world from the Coop organization.

## Key Princeliness

- Modularity - Simplify integration into existing projects.
- Reusability - Reducing the need for duplicate code and speeding up the
  development process.
- Scalability - Designed with scalability in mind, these packages can be easily
  adapted or extended.
